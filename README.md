# Terrain-Sketching

## Implementation of the Terrain Sketching [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1507149.1507155).

## Tech Stack: C++, OpenGL 

1. Fully implemented sketching interface for different drawing modes.
2. Custom terrain mesh for proper deformation
3. Implementation of the terrain deformation algorithm, given the user sketches as constraints. 
4. Standard implementation of Blinn-Phong lighting model.
